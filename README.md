# catpopsup

This website was created as a fun project to test and improve my front-end development skills. The main feature of the site is a playful input field that whenever you type into the input field two random cat images instantly pop up on the screen. The goal was to practice working with user input and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

I built this project to experiment and challenge myself while fun. I hope everyone who visits the site enjoys the ki ki cats!
